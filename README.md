# Engineering Assessment Backend (NestJS)

## Project Initialization

1. Clone this repository locally

2. Create a new working branch (e.g. `git checkout -b working-branch`)

3. Set your node environment

   - Run `nvm install && nvm use`, or

   - Alternatively manually set your node to v18+ and npm to v10+

4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

   Note: Ensure you have properly set your node version before this step

5. Run `npm run start:dev` or `npm run start:debug` to spin-up the backend

   Your backend server should be running on `localhost:3000`, unless a different port is defined in `process.env.PORT`.

   You can check that the server is running correctly by trying the base endpoint `GET http://localhost:3000`, which should return the text "Hello World!"
